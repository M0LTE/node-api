                Packet Network Monitoring Project

                      JSON Report Format

About This Document

   This document describes the format of the JSON messages sent by
   XRouter v504j to an experimental server currently hosted by OARC.

   The purpose of the project is to collect such reports from all
   participating nodes, and make them available for network research,
   monitoring, and fault tracing.

   Each message or "report" is sent by XRouter upon transmitting or
   receiving an AX25 frame of any type.  Each report consists of
   an unnamed JSON object, transported in a UDP datagram.

   Reports have a variable format, depending on the AX25 frame
   contents.

   It is hoped that, once the format is finalised, all node software
   will support the project to a greater or lesser extent.

   There is no requirement for node software authors to support all of
   the reports or optional fields detailed in this document.

   This is a draft specification.  Comments and suggestions are
   welcomed.


1.  AX25 Layer 2 Trace Fields

   These fields are always present (i.e. "required"):

      Name  Required  Type     Description
      ----------------------------------------------------
      "@type"      Y  String   Type of object, i.e. "L2Trace"
      "reportFrom" Y  String   Reporter's callsign, e.g. nodecall
      "port"       Y  String   Port ID, e.g. "3" or "4mlink"
      "srce"       Y  String   Source callsign, e.g. "G8PZT-1"
      "dest"       Y  String   Destination callsign, e.g "M0AHN"
      "ctrl"       Y  Integer  AX25 control field numeric value. (*1)
      "l2type"     Y  String   Frame type mnemonic, e.g. "I", "RR" (*2)
      "cr"         Y  String   Cmd/Response bit "C", "R", or "V1" (*3)

      (*1) Applications may wish to decode the control field themselves
           instead of using the decoded "l2type" field.

      (*2) Possible values for the "l2type" string:

         Mnemonic  Meaning
         ---------------------------------------------------
         "SABME"   Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode Extended
         "C"       Non-extended connnect request (AKA SABM)
         "D"       Disconnect Request
         "DM"      Disconnected Mode / Busy
         "UA"      Unnumbered Acknowledgement
         "UI"      Unnumbered Information frame
         "I"       Numbered information frame
         "FRMR"    Frame Reject (serious error)
         "RR"      Receiver Ready
         "RNR"     Receiver Not Ready

         "?"       Unknown type
         "XID"     AX.25 V2.2
         "TEXT"    AX.25 V2.2
         "SREJ"    AX.25 V2.2

      (*3) Possible values for the "cr" (Command/Response) field are
           as follows:

           "C"    Command
           "R"    Response
           "V1"   AX25 version 1

   The following fields are optional, as they only exist in some
   frame types:

      Name  Required Type     Description
      ----------------------------------------------------
      "digis"     N  Array    List of digipeater calls (*4)
      "rseq"      N  Integer  Receive sequence number (i.e. expected)
      "tseq"      N  Integer  Transmit (send) sequence number
      "pf"        N  String   Poll/Final bit, either "P" or "F"
      "pid"       N  Integer  Next layer protocol number in decimal (*5)
      "ptcl"      N  String   Next layer protocol in words (*6)
      "ilen"      N  Integer  Length of information field (*7)

    (*4) The "digis" field is only present if there are digipeaters in
         the destination path.  If present, the field value is a JSON
         array of digipeater objects.  Each digipeater object contains
         two mandatory fields as follows:

         Name  Required  Type     Description
         ---------------------------------------------------------
         "call"       Y  String    Digipeater's callsign+SSID
         "rptd"       N  Boolean   True if digi repeated the packet

    (*5) The "pid" value includes the two high order bits which are
         usually set to one, but are sometimes used for layer 2
         fragmentation.

    (*6) Possible values for the "ptcl" (Layer 3 protocol) field:

         Mnemonic    Meaning
         --------------------------------------------------------
         "SEG"       Intermediate segment of a fragmented packet
         "DATA"      No layer 3, i.e. payload contains normal data

         "IP"        Payload contains IP datagram or part thereof
         "ARP"       Payload contains ARP data
         "?"         Unknown layer 3 protocol

    (*7) The "ilen" field is only present in frame types "I" and "UI".

         Boolean values are omitted if they are unknown, or do not
         apply. "isNode" means that "call" applies to a conventional
         node, not a direct connect to an application. "isBBS" means
         that the callsign connects *directly* to a BBS, and so on.

         The "timestamp" field indicates when the data was last updated
         by the destination node.

3.  Event and Status Reports

   Event reports are sent to the server whenever a significant event,
   such as link connection or disconnection occurs.  Status reports
   are sent at regular intervals to convey additional information.

3.1.  Node Up Event

   This report is sent when a node software starts running. The JSON
   fields are as follows: 

      Name  Required  Type     Description
      -------------------------------------------------------------
      "@type"      Y  String   Report type: "NodeUpEvent"
      "nodeCall"   Y  String   Node Callsign
      "nodeAlias"  Y  String   Node Alias
      "locator"    Y  String   Maidenhead locator e.g. "IO82VJ"
      "software"   Y  String   Node software type, e.g. "xrlin"
      "version"    Y  String   Node software Version, e.g. "v504j"
      "latitude"   N  Number   Decimal degrees (optional)
      "longitude"  N  Number   Decimal degrees (optional)

   Locator should be enough to place a node on the map, but some sysops
   like greater precision, hence they suppy an exact lat/lon as well.

3.2.  Node Down Event

   This report is when a node is in the process of going offline.  It
   is unlikely to be sent when a node crashes, unless the error handler
   is hooked.  However a crash may be inferred if a node fails to report
   within a reasonable interval, or if a subsequent NodeUpEvent
   is received with the same callsign and alias.  The JSON fields are
   as follows:

      Name  Required  Type     Description
      -------------------------------------------------------------
      "@type"      Y  String   Report type: "NodeDownEvent"
      "nodeCall"   Y  String   Node Callsign
      "nodeAlias"  Y  String   Node Alias
      "reason"     N  String   Reason for the shutdown, e.g. "reboot"

   The "reason" field is optional.  The other fields are required.

3.3.  Node Status Report

   This report serves three purposes.  Firstly it confirms the node's
   existence in case a NodeUpEvent was not seen, because some nodes
   may be up for months or years.  Secondly, it conveys additional
   status information such as "uptime" which may be useful if a node
   keeps disappearing after a certain uptime. Thirdly, it is sent at
   regular intervals, so a sudden lack of reports could indicate that
   a node had crashed without sending a NodeDownEvent.  This allows
   the consumer of the data to purge expired nodes from the database,
   and maybe to alert people that a node was potentially down.

      Name   Required  Type     Description
      -------------------------------------------------------------
      "@type"       Y  String   Report type: "NodeStatus"
      "nodeCall"    Y  String   Node Callsign
      "nodeAlias"   Y  String   Node Alias
      "locator"     Y  String   Maidenhead locator e.g. "IO82VJ"
      "software"    Y  String   Node software type, e.g. "xrlin"
      "version"     Y  String   Node software Version, e.g. "v504j"
      "uptimeSecs"  Y  Integer  Node's uptime in seconds
      "latitude"    N  Number   Decimal degrees (optional)
      "longitude"   N  Number   Decimal degrees (optional)


3.4.  Link Connection Event

   This report is sent when an AX25 connection first enters the
   "connected" state.  The JSON fields (all required) are as follows:

       Name  Required  Type     Description
      -------------------------------------------------------------
      "@type"       Y  String   Report type: "LinkUpEvent"
      "node"        Y  String   Callsign of reporting node
      "id"          Y  Integer  Link serial number
      "direction"   Y  String   Initiator: "Incoming" or "outgoing"
      "port"        Y  String   Port identifier, e.g. "2"
      "remote"      Y  String   Remote callsign
      "local"       Y  String   Local callsign

      For the "direction" field, "incoming" indicates that the event
      was initiated from the remote end (i.e. an uplink), and
      "outgoing" means that it was initiated from the local end, i.e.
      a downlink.

3.5.  Link Disconnection Event

   This report is sent when an AX25 connection is destroyed.  The JSON
   fields are as follows. All but the "reason" field are required:

      Name  Required  Type     Description
      -------------------------------------------------------------
      "@type"       Y  String   Report type: "LinkDownEvent"
      "node"        Y  String   Callsign of reporting node
      "id"          Y  Integer  Link serial number
      "direction"   Y  String   Initiator: "Incoming" or "outgoing"
      "port"        Y  String   Port identifier, e.g. "2"
      "remote"      Y  String   Remote callsign
      "local"       Y  String   Local callsign
      "frmsSent"    Y  Integer  Total frames sent since link creation
      "frmsRcvd"    Y  Integer  Total frames rcvd since link creation
      "frmsResent"  Y  Integer  Total frames re-sent

      "reason"      N  String   e.g. "Retried out" (optional field)
      "bytesRcvd"   N  Integer  Total bytes received since link creation (optional)
      "bytesSent"   N  Integer  Total bytes sent since link creation (optional)

      For the "direction" field, "incoming" indicates that the
      disconection was initiated from the remote end, and "outgoing"
      means that it was initiated from the local end.


3.6.  Link Status Report

   This report is sent at regular intervals during the lifetime of the
   connection, to convey additional information about the performance
   of the link.  The JSON fields are as follows:
